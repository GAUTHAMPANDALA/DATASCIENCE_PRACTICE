    "# USAGE OF WORKING WITH TEXT DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "    In data analysis as we have introduced the method/procedure to optimise the table, it is selective to optimise the table in order to save meomory.when we receive a data set even if we're working with something like strings the data may not be in ideal shape for us to perform our proper data analysis.We may have things like capitalization problems we may have situations where we have more than one thing represented within a cell and we need to split it up. We may have rendering issues as we'll see in just a second with things like currencies many other different problems.And in order to solve those problems Panas includes many different string methods that we can call on a data frame or the series within a data frame to help us fix those problems.for example our titles here and our departments are in all capital letters,That's kind of a little bit where we see here that our names our last names and our first names are stored within a single column.So if I want to do something like separate them like find the last name and the first name of each person in order to split into two separate columns we're going to have to find some unique string method to call.\n",
    "      In python we cannot make a value by adding teh special symbols to them ,this is incase of in money adding \" \"$\" to a value of numbers makes them to strng, so we cannot perfoem numericla operations for them, and conversion of float form is also diffrcult as '$' is the string object format. So, inorder to work with this type of data woriking with Text data is introduced."
